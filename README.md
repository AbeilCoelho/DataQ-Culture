# DataQ Culture - Data Quality Assessment Tool for Cultural Collections

The DataQ Culture is a data quality assessment tool designed for cultural collections, developed as a master's project at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (Ufes) in Brazil. The objective of DataQ Culture is to assist professionals and institutions in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data within their cultural collections.

The tool is based on the Catalogue of Cultural Objects (CCO), an international reference guide for cataloging cultural objects. This enables users to calculate a quality index that reflects the level of confidence in the integrity and accuracy of data within a cultural collection. This index is established based on a set of criteria according to the guidelines outlined by CCO.

DataQ Culture provides an easy and efficient solution for maintaining data quality in cultural collections, enabling the identification of issues and correction of errors before they escalate or lead to irreparable damage. Additionally, the tool can also be used to monitor real-time data quality and ensure that data within a cultural collection remains accurate and up-to-date, following the international standards set by CCO.
